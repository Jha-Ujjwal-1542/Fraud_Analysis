# Project Objectives

Provider Fraud is one of the biggest problems facing Medicare. According to the government, the total Medicare spending increased exponentially due to frauds in Medicare claims. Healthcare fraud is an organized crime which involves peers of providers, physicians, beneficiaries acting together to make fraud claims.<br>
Rigorous analysis of Medicare data has yielded many physicians who indulge in fraud. They adopt ways in which an ambiguous diagnosis code is used to adopt costliest procedures and drugs. Insurance companies are the most vulnerable institutions impacted due to these bad practices. Due to this reason, insurance companies increased their insurance premiums and as result healthcare is becoming costly matter day by day.

Healthcare fraud and abuse take many forms. Some of the most common types of frauds by providers are:
<br>
a)	Billing for services that were not provided.
<br>
b)	Duplicate submission of a claim for the same service.
<br>
c)	Misrepresenting the service provided.
<br>
d)	Charging for a more complex or expensive service than was provided.
<br>
e)	Billing for a covered service when the service provided was not covered.
